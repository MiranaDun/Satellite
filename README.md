# Satellite
Project from Zimina Arina and Siniatullina Karina

The planet Earth rotating around its axis, satellite 1 (real Earth satellite) is presented, which rotates in circular and ellipsoidal orbits.

R=6371

h=200

a=6955.2

e=0.05201

q=6586

Q=7310


for circular orbit:

T=88.64*((R+h)/R)**(3/2)=88.65667672775555

V=7.91*(R/(R+h))**0.5=7.788692398610337


for ellipsoidal orbit:

r=(a*(1-e**2))/1=6936.38590509648

V=7.91*((2*R/r)-(R/a))**0.5=7.591022199029516


Due to the permission in Unity, the scale of the Earth and the satellite are reduced, but correlate with each other.
